This is a package for [isomor](https://github.com/apiel/isomor).

`Isomor` is a library to create an interface between your backend and your frontend with nodejs and javascript application. Today, fullstack developers often use monorepo to centralize all their architecture inside a single place. This library allow you to do even more. Instead to have different application for backend and frontend, you develop a single "isomorphic" application and `isomor` will take care to split the code and setup a communication protocole.
