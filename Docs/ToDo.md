### ToDo

- isomor pkg remove dependency to server and transpiler?

- isomor-NG > nest + angular
    - isomor-ng-nest
    - vscode
    - should we provide a way to use something else than axios, like HttpClient from angular?
    - should we provide a way to use something else than express, like nest server?
    - maybe later: should as well allow decorator only per method

- ~~@share in addition of IsomorShare (give the possibility to use one or the other)~~

- refactor transformer and move each in different file
    - rename tranformerImport to transformImport... and so on

- params checking in endpoint base on types

- vscode extension handle delete and move file

- review doc
- video
- provide some test-case example, unit test and integration test
- angular example


- **base on params types of server function generate validation on endpoint**
  - maybe while transpiling
  - or
  - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33800497/check-if-an-object-implements-an-interface-at-runtime-with-typescript
  - https://github.com/pcan/reflec-ts-examples/tree/master/simple-validator



- test:
  - isomor-server
  - integration, for file structure after transpiling?

- think about https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/ CHANGELOG.md



- isomor-rendering, pre-rendering caching... out of scope, so maybe not do it!


- ~~FIX: transpiler file does not always get copy~~
  -> ~~after copy, look if the two files are the same, if not copy again~~

- ? isomor-cli > for install react or vue, and maybe some other feature

- Provide all devops around isomor (docker container, docker compose? maybe even deplyoment script?)
