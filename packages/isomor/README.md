This package is a library for [isomor](https://github.com/apiel/isomor).

`isomor` give the possibility to develop a web application in a single project by abstracting the layers between frontend and backend.  Instead to implement an API, using REST or graphql, isomor will allow you to call the server functions directly from the UI code, without to think about the communication protocol. Isomor will take care to generate automatically those layers for you. All your code is implemented in the same folder and isomor will automatically separate them by using Babel transpiler. Since your code is tight together, there is much more consistency, that is one of the big advantage of using isomor, especially with TypeScript. It remove as well lot of overhead and let you focus on implementing features.
