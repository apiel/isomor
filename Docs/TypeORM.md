## TypeORM

[TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/) is a data-Mapper ORM for TypeScript. Supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, SQLite, MS SQL Server, Oracle, MongoDB databases.

TypeORM supports both Active Record and Data Mapper patterns, unlike all other JavaScript ORMs currently in existence, which means you can write high quality, loosely coupled, scalable, maintainable applications the most productive way.

Since I really like this library, I wanted to give an example to use it with isomor to show how simple it is to use a database and how concistant it is.

[>> **example here** <<](https://github.com/apiel/isomor/tree/master/packages/example/react-typeorm)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apiel/isomor.git
cd packages/examples/react-typeorm
yarn
yarn prod
# or yarn dev
```
